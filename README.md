# d1_pypackage

Implements a python tool for serializing data packages from DataONE

The goal of this activity is to implement a tool in Python that given a PID,
will retrieve the contents and create a local copy of the content in a
consistent way that is compliant with the Metacat implementation of BagIt
serialization for content.

See the [wiki for more details](https://github.com/DataONEorg/d1_pypackage/wiki).
